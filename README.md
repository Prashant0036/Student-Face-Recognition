The rapid advancements in computer vision and machine learning have
paved the way for innovative applications in various domains. Face
recognition, as a subfield of computer vision, has gained significant
attention due to its potential applications in security systems, attendance
management, and personalized user experiences. This project aims to
develop a face recognition system using the Support Vector Machine (SVM)
algorithm to classify students in a specific branch. The system will be
implemented using Python and Flask for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript for the frontend.
